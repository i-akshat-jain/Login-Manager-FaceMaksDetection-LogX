## General Information
- Amid the second wave of corona pandemic, we feel it's our moral duty, as engineers, to develop some solutions which can help the community out there. So we came up with this Face 
  mask detection project and intergrated it with an app to make contactless attendance system. This project can be implemented at any office / school or administration places where 
  we need to make sure that the person entering the premise is wearing proper mask or not, for the safety for all. Our Project got appretiation from various national newspapers and 
  TV News channels such as <font color="green">Rajasthan Patrika, News Nation, News18 India etc.</font>

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python
* Tensorflow (Keras)
* KivyMD
* MySQL

## Setup
This project is built on python==3.8 version. This whole program requiered KivyMD, Tensorflow, Keras, MySQL. Some more python libraries like pyqrcode, date time, matplotlib etc. are requiered for completing the task. All these can be installed easily form terminal. The whole project was created on VScode. 

## Room for Improvement
Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

Room for improvement:
- This kivy application will be rebuilt on flutter for commercial use.
- The face mask detecction model will be trained on a huge amount of dataset for more accuracy with an improper mask functionallity added.
- The mask detection model will be deployed on Ras Pie or Ardino for stand alone functioning.
